<section><h2>For The Most Part, Though, Dead Is Dead In The Mcu.</h2><br/><p>Marvel&#039;s eternals screenwriter kaz firpo confirms the film&#039;s major death and explains how and why they arrived at the decision to kill this character. Marvel&#039;s eternals ended with the death of ikaris, albeit in a tremendously appropriate way. The first character to be killed in eternals is the groupâs leader, ajak, who appears to have been killed by the deviants but whose death was orchestrated by ikaris who wanted to end her.</p><h2>Created By Jack Kirby, These Powerful Gods First Appeared In 1976&#039;S The Eternals #1, One Of The Comics He Created After He Returned To Work For Marvel Following His Time At Dc Comics.</h2><br/><p>This story contains spoilers for marvel's eternals. In a scene ending eternals, loyal soldier ikaris (richard madden) flies too close. It allowed us to meet new superheroes, each as authentic as the next, that fans of the marvel comics have been waiting to see on the big screen for a long time.</p><h2>Eternals Writer Kaz Firpo Has Shared Some Insight Into Whether One Of The Movie&#039;s Characters Actually Died In Those Final Few Minutes, And The Answer May Not Be The One Many Of You Were Hoping For.</h2><br/><p>One of the strongest eternals out there is gilgamesh (don lee), making his death all the more surprising. He kept thena (angelina jolie) in check for some 500 years, protecting the world of herself. Eternals&#039; ending cuts away from him before his fiery death is explicitly shown, which leaves his mcu fate ambiguous.</p><h2>Marvel&#039;s Eternals Writer Confirms A Character&#039;s Death [Spoiler] Warning:</h2><br/><p>Hours before she died, flack learned that she&#039;d be tried for an assault on partner lewis burton, an incident captured on police bodycam which depicted her partially undressed and under severe emotional stress. Marvel&#039;s eternals writer confirms [spoiler] is dead. While the more obvious answer is that killing off all the eternals would also kill off their future in the mcu and close the door on future installmentsâsomething marvel and disney are unlikely to do after only one filmâarishem&#039;s decision to spare the eternals also helps to flesh out the nature of the celestials and hint at earth&#039;s origins and purpose.</p><h2>However, It Is Unclear How They Would Know Of That Fact.</h2><br/><p>Now according to the latest revelation made for eternals writer kaz firpo, richard maddenâs ikaris is actually dead in the mcu. From the eternals, gilgamesh (killed by kro in the amazon rainforest) and ajak (killed by deviants) are definitely dead. Even though the film does establish that eternals can die, it doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re gone forever (sorry, we really love richard madden and want more of him in the mcu).</p></section><section><aside><img alt="Studio Ghibli&#039;s Only Yesterday Trailer, With Star Wars" rel="nofollow" title="Studio Ghibli&#039;s Only Yesterday Trailer, With Star Wars" src="https://i2.wp.com/media.comicbook.com/2015/12/only-yesterday-daisy-ridley-164328-1280x0.jpg" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><small><i>Images: bing.com</i></small><br/><p><a href="#" target="_blank"><i>Studio Ghibli&#039;s Only Yesterday Trailer, With Star Wars</i></a>, According to the sun, flack was found dead in her london apartment in 2020, with authorities ruling the death a suicide.

In a scene ending eternals, loyal soldier ikaris (richard madden) flies too close. It allowed us to meet new superheroes, each as authentic as the next, that fans of the marvel comics have been waiting to see on the big screen for a long time. Comics have never exactly had a reputation for taking death particularly seriously, so much so that the phrase comic book death is now taken to refer to a throwaway death done for shock purposes that will swiftly be reversed.

While that would be impressive for any characters, it's shocking for the eternals since their last major comic book appearance saw them all found dead during an avengers story in 2018. While the more obvious answer is that killing off all the eternals would also kill off their future in the mcu and close the door on future installmentsâsomething marvel and disney are unlikely to do after only one filmâarishem's decision to spare the eternals also helps to flesh out the nature of the celestials and hint at earth's origins and purpose. Created by jack kirby, these powerful gods first appeared in 1976's the eternals #1, one of the comics he created after he returned to work for marvel following his time at dc comics.
