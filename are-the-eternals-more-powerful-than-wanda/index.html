<section><h2>No Matter Which Way You Look At It, The Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) Is The Strongest Character In The Marvel.</h2><br/><p>I know they&#039;re hyped to be stronger than avengers but individually i doubt if they&#039;re more powerful than carol/wanda/thor. Captain america and iron man, for example, might land some attacks, but they wouldn’t stand a chance against the eternals’ powerful energy. While the eternals and the celestials bring some strong firepower to the mcu, wanda maximoff is still the strongest character of them.</p><h2>This Is Also Illustrated In The Power Grid Above, Which Shows That There Is A Significant Difference In Power Between The Two.</h2><br/><p>The great story behind wanda is her life has caused her to lose a lot of the control she otherwise could have had. Every living being meets her at one point or another. Wandavision finale reveals that scarlet witch is more powerful than doctor strange.</p><h2>He Also Has Super Speed That Doesn’t Get To.</h2><br/><p>Ikaris (richard madden) is stronger than most eternals, losing in sheer strength only to gilgamesh. I am answering this question from a comics standpoint, sersi has yet to appear in the movies. The eternals are (mostly) more powerful than the avengers created by legendary comic book writer and artist jack kirby in the late 1970s, the eternals, like thanos, are an immortal species who have super strength and the abilities of teleportation, telepathy, telekinesis, and flight — among others.</p><h2>Which Is More Powerful Between Scarlet Witch, The Mutant Avenger, Or Sersi Of The Eternals?</h2><br/><p>The answer to this question given those parameters is scarlet witch. Additional {powerful} characters resembling wanda (elizabeth olsen), captain marvel (brie larson), and doctor strange (benedict cumberbatch) are all pretty {powerful}, however they more than likely don’t have the identical mastery of their skills because the eternals who’ve been round for hundreds of years. The eternals’ powers are much more potent than those of the avengers.</p><h2>Wanda Has More Potential Because Her Power Affects Matter Differently Than Sersei’s.</h2><br/><p>They have been in existence for thousands of years, quietly living among human beings who are mostly unaware of their powers. Sersi is the eternals’ version of wanda, in a way, but since the eternals are so much more powerful than regular humans (mutants included), it is quite natural for sersi to be so much stronger than wanda. If wanda maximoff has been able to learn how to control the chaos magic of the scarlet witch, with help from the darkhold, she is absolutely stronger than the eternals.</p></section><section><aside><img alt="8 Magic Characters We Want to See Come to the MCU Nerdist" rel="nofollow" title="8 Magic Characters We Want to See Come to the MCU Nerdist" src="https://i2.wp.com/nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/marvel-modred-526x520.jpg" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><small><i>Images: pinterest.com</i></small><br/><p><a href="#" target="_blank"><i>8 Magic Characters We Want to See Come to the MCU Nerdist</i></a>, They have been in existence for thousands of years, quietly living among human beings who are mostly unaware of their powers.

The eternals are (mostly) more powerful than the avengers created by legendary comic book writer and artist jack kirby in the late 1970s, the eternals, like thanos, are an immortal species who have super strength and the abilities of teleportation, telepathy, telekinesis, and flight — among others. Wanda was revealed to be a powerful entity known as the scarlet witch. Wandavision finale reveals that scarlet witch is more powerful than doctor strange.</p></section></article>
