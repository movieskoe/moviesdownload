I for one am looking more forward to shazam, since (from the one trailer i watched at least) the dc captain marvel has way more personality and the movie might have way more heart, although he is supposed yo be on par with the likes of superman (a.k.a he&#039;s supposed to be the strongest superhero as well).</p><h2>Civil War In Terms Of Character Count.</h2><br/><p>Captain marvel was a bad movie.

The original hero called captain marvel, who currently goes by the name shazam, was one of the most popular superheroes of the golden age of the 1940s.</p><h2>Captain Marvel Hasn’t Hit Theaters, Yet It Garnered A Dismal Audience Score Of 54 Percent—Far Below The Totals For Other Recent Marvel Movies.</h2><br/><p>If the reports turn out to be true, it&#039;s safe to say that marvel studios fully trusts dacosta to handle a massive story, and this also reinforces larson&#039;s claim that she is “the best person for the job.” Marvel movies ranked best to worst. The poor grade is the result of “review bombing,” a practice that’s also widespread in the highly charged world of video gaming.</p><h2>This Is My Favorite Because It Takes Its Self Seriously, It Rarely Takes The Piss And Ruins The Moment, But Instead Turns A Franchise That Could Have Easily Been The First Two Thor Movies And.</h2><br/><p>Marvel studios is looking for a female director for captain marvel 2, and here are some potentially great fits.
