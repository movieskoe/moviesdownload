The first reason is logical:</p><h2>He Does Good But In A Bad Bad Way.</h2><br/><p>The symbiote bonded with him and they became venom. While i also love remender’s agent venom, eddie will always be best venom, and he is not a hero or a villain just a normal guy who makes really bad decisions trying to make better ones.

Venom is supposed to be a villain, but latter the writer wanted him to be a villain and a good guy at the same time, what made the character extremely confused and inconsistent, with his motivations being all over the place (at the point that, to this day, readers doesn't know for sure if he's a bad or a good guy).</p><aside><img alt="Venom 2 Title Scoob Goes to VOD Comic Con Cancelled" rel="nofollow" title="Venom 2 Title Scoob Goes to VOD Comic Con Cancelled" src="https://i2.wp.com/i.ytimg.com/vi/1Dz2ExRLnj8/maxresdefault.jpg" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><small><i>Images: google.com</i></small><br/><p><a href="#" target="_blank"><i>Venom 2 Title Scoob Goes to VOD Comic Con Cancelled</i></a>, It&#039;d be better than a new venom every 13 months.
