I think one of the issues is that marvel’s had consistent leadership for the last 15 years or more, whereas dc hasn’t. 30.maybe a bit older and higher.more likely to prefer dc.</p><h2>Marvel And Dc Comics Main Difference Was Originally Dc Making Larger Than Life Stories Of Superheroes And Marvel Made Down To Earth Stories About People With Superpowers.</h2><br/><p>This makes it more successful, especially in regards to the film franchises. A large reason why wonder woman was created and published in 1941 was because of world war ii. Marvel introduces their heroes better, has more relatable villains, and their movies are just funnier overall than dc movies.</p></section><section><aside><img alt="Limbo review (Switch) A Calm, Nightmare ⋆ Shindig" rel="nofollow" title="Limbo review (Switch) A Calm, Nightmare ⋆ Shindig" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.shindig.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/limbo-header.jpg" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><small><i>Images: bing.com</i></small><br/><p><a href="#" target="_blank"><i>Limbo review (Switch) A Calm, Nightmare ⋆ Shindig</i></a>, Marvel did a far better job of introducing and uniting its heroes in the first team up movie than dc did.
