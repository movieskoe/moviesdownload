Venom was never meant to be a villain in marvel comics venom is one of marvel’s greatest villains, but had the alien symbiote actually gotten the life it wanted, it would have never gone bad! Spiderman gets a suit in secret wars that turns out to be a klyntar symbiote.</p><h2>One Of The Most Unique Aspects Of Venom Is That His Powers Are Sentient.</h2><br/><p>Villain, but not the type who has evil plans and machinations. Then he was an anti hero that still helped people but hated spidey.

The answer to whether venom is more hero or villain lies in the distinction between venom&#039;s two halves.</p><h2>His Whole Babbling About Innocents Was Meant To Show That He Was A.</h2><br/><p>Let us do a flashback: Is venom&#039;s new villain virus secretly [spoiler]?
