<section><h2>Venom Is A Fictional Character Appearing In American Comic Books Published By Marvel Comics.</h2><br/><p>Most of the time, people look to heroes to take on the big bads of a comic universe. Venom #1 is picking up the torch of what came before, but. Venom has almost held the lead role before</p><h2>Since That Time The Symbiote Has Been Variously Tampered With Or Changed Hosts, Causing It To Relapse Into Predatory, Villainous Behavior, But Under Brock It Tends To Prefer Something Skewing Closer To Being A Good Guy.</h2><br/><p>Al eweing, ram v, bryan hitch/marvel comics. Venom’s heroism is not much more expressed, but he doesn’t always do it as the heroes would. It’s kind of the typical angsty teenager story, at least by way of cosmic calamity.</p><h2>While We Love Him In Both Roles, We Have A List Of 5 Reasons He&#039;s Much Better As A Hero And 5 Reasons Why He Really Should Just Stick To Being A Villain.</h2><br/><p>Despite its violent content, the filmmakers decided to make it available to children. I&#039;ve always enjoyed agent venom the most personally, so hero. Let us do a flashback:</p><h2>Venom Really Has Been Both A Great Hero And A Terrible Villain Over The Course Of The Comics And Indeed The Films.</h2><br/><p>Venom doesn&#039;t need to be a villain. Overall, venom, wich to me should only be eddie brock, because imo, venom should be the fusion between the symbioye and brock especifically, anyone else bonding with it should be another thing, is better as a villain, mostly because his concept is solid and good villains are hard to come by these days in superhero stories. As it turns more and more to evil, it interferes with venom&#039;s attempts to cleanse itself of this same corrupt influence.</p><h2>For All His Sins, Venom Continuously Shows He’s Struggling To Escape His Traumatic Past And Not Be A Villain.</h2><br/><p>Ground zeroes, the main protagonist of metal gear solid v: The phantom pain and the secondary antagonist of the original metal gear game.
