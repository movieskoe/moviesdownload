Snake venom works by releasing toxic proteins and enzymes into the body. “the oral venom systems found in snakes are particularly complex, and the origin of their venoms is still unclear.”</p><h2>However, We Do Not Recommend Drinking Venom!</h2><br/><p>The venom constitutes families of proteins and peptides with various isoforms that make it a cocktail of diverse molecules.
