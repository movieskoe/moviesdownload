Every major symbiote in marvel explained.</p><h2>The Son Of Carnage, Toxin, Was Believed To Be The Most Powerful Symbiote Ever Created.</h2><br/><p>Toxin was the most powerful symbiote on the planet earth when he first appeared, the 1,000th spawn of carnage. Tanis nevies first appeared in carnage #1 (december 2010), while the scorn symbiote first appeared in carnage #4 (june 2011). Like most other symbiotes, it is vulnerable to sound and fire.</p><h2>If It Uses Its Abilities Too Much, Its Power Will Wane, Leaving It Susceptible To All Kinds Of Attacks.</h2><br/><p>The beings now known on earth simply as symbiotes are a. Its strength is more or less on par with the regular venom symbiote. She wasn&#039;t the original leader of the team but her powers, greater than all of the other symbiotes, earned her the top billing spot pretty quickly.</p><h2>Also Of Note, Toxin Doesn&#039;t Have The Usual Sonic And Fire Weaknesses Of A Symbiote, So One Could Speculate That Eddie&#039;s.</h2><br/><p>The symbiotes (originally known as klyntars) are a race of extraterrestrial parasites which appear in the marvel comics universe. Donna diego was a mentally disturbed woman who eventually became involved with the life foundation, and later became a host for one of venom&#039;s child symbiotes.

Although toxin is the strongest symbiote, knull is the guy who essentially created him and all other symbiotes.
